I completed a Masters of Science degree in CS from Georgia Tech in August 2021! Because many of the projects I worked on for classes are still being used, plagiarism rules prevent me from sharing all the details of what I worked on in the program. But I can share some particular projects and classes!

## CS 7643, Deep Learning

The fourth assignment for this class, written in Python using PyTorch, had two components. First, I implemented several basic units used in the (Seq2Seq)[https://google.github.io/seq2seq/] framework, including RNN and LSTM units and a single-layer Transformer encoder. Second, I trained a network built using these units and the Seq2Seq framework to translate German sentences to English.
