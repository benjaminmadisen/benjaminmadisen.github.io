# About Me: Overview

Hello! I'm Ben White, and I work at the intersection of data and computers! That's obviously a massive category, so let me break it down a bit.

My first passion was math and economics, and a lot of my undergrad background was in statistical inference and experimental design. I love thinking about what we can infer from observational data, and more importantly what we can't! I'm motivated by a curiosity about the world, and the rigor and precision of statistical modeling feels like one of the best tools for getting at the truth about how things work.

But I also grew up surrounded by programming, and from that found a love of automation and standardization. And my work with statistical modeling showed me just how important it can be: disparate sources, ad hoc processes, and poor validation are by far the easiest way to get bad results. Beyond that, it's often critical to examine datasets constructed with slightly different configurations - and I've found that I love building the structures and pipelines that help me avoid getting bogged down rewriting the processing steps.

And it should be no surprise that someone who loves programming and statistics eventually found their way to machine learning. I'm fascinated by so many different parts of the field: the elegance of the models from a computer science perspective, their power as a predictive tool, and perhaps most of all the breadth of their potential applications. I spent a few years exploring the field in my free time, and eventually my curiosity got the better of me: I spend a few years working through graduate computer science classes to better understand all the papers I'd been reading.

I'm not sure one term fits my whole background: it's a hodgepodge, with stats, data engineering, and machine learning all mixed together. I do think they are particularly powerful in combination. Working on inference, I know my input data has been processed rigorously and I have a wealth of predictive models to borrow from. Working on pipelines, I have a strong intuition for validating and debugging data issues through statistics and I understand the nuts and bolts of the predictive engines often at the end. And working on machine learning applications, I am statistically rigorous in checking outputs and how my process is set up end-to-end. If you have an interesting project or job and are looking for someone working on one of these three (and especially if you're looking for someone who can do all of these three!) let me know! I'm always looking for opportunities where I can learn more about techniques, tools, or how the world works.
